REM Title: OS X Reverse Shell
REM Author: Miguel Mota (moogs)
REM Starts a reverse bash shell instance in the background that connects to your server on port 1337.
REM Make sure on your server to run the listener first: nc -l -p 1337
REM Note: Replace `0.0.0.0` with your server's IP address.
REM Tested with duck encoder v2.6.3

REM For some reason (maybe keyboard layout) `&` becomes `'` and `^` becomes `&` when ducky is typing; so doing it that way.
